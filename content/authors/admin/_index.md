Hi there! I'm Kuan Wei Yu. I am currently a Master's student in Computer Engineering at New York University. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from National Taiwan University in 2018.

This Fall, I will join [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) as a Research Software Development Engineer Intern. I will help the team with the cloud deployment using Kubernetes. 

I am currently working at Alibaba as a Java R&D Intern. Previously, I worked at [ASUS Intelligent Cloud Services](https://aics.asus.com/), developing the Kubernetes optimization.

I am actively looking for 2021 Summer Software Engineer positions, if you have any opportunity, feel free to contact me through my [Email](mailto:kwy232@nyu.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuanweiyu/). 

Thanks for stopping by!
